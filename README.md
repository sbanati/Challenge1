## An example PROJECT using  HTML, CSS, and Git. A marketing agency hired me to refactor their site specifically to make it more accessible. 



<p>This project was an example of how to refactor an existing page for the purpose of increasing the accessibility.
I was given a starter code of both HTML and CSS where the existing webpage was formated and told to keep the web page to 
90% of its likeness. Additionally I was tasked with formatting the source code to have SEMANTIC elements only. Below is a 
list of specific changes made following the acceptance criteria. </p>

***

* Replaced non semantics with more appropriate semantic tags. 
* Added accessible alt attributes.
* Used the WAVE Evaluation Tool plugin to correct any accessibility errors. 
* Added a new title and ordered headings chronologically (h1-h6) based on importance of information.
* Consolidated the CSS selectors and properties for an organized flow.
* Added comments on the CSS file make navigation smoother and communicate better.
